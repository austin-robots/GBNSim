A Python-based simulation of the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol with a Tkinter GUI. Configure packet loss, window size, and delays to visualize reliable data transfer in action.

This project is a complete simulation of the Go-Back-N (GBN) Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol, implemented in Python with an interactive GUI interface. It is designed to demonstrate how reliable data transfer works over unreliable networks, focusing on the behavior of senders, receivers, and the network under various conditions. The Go-Back-N protocol allows the sender to transmit multiple packets (up to a configurable window size) without waiting for individual acknowledgments. If a packet is lost or an acknowledgment fails to arrive, the sender retransmits the packet that timed out along with all subsequent packets in the window. The receiver accepts only in-order packets and discards any out-of-order data. This simulator supports real-time configuration of the protocol, including sender window size, sequence number space, propagation delay, and custom-defined packet or acknowledgment losses. It also features a detailed log of sender and receiver behavior, including packet transmission, loss detection, timeout events, retransmissions, and final data delivery. The system uses Pythonâ€™s threading to emulate concurrency between the sender, receiver, and network.
